Incomplete, in development.

Implementing a Binary Tree in Java, later to joined by a Priority Queue repo,
both to be used in developing a Huffman routine. This will be used to augment
the performance of the Perl routine in ITFC and BISONTE repos, which should
make the textfile compressor (comprised of these combined) consistently more
efficient than gzip (currently it is on average about the same).

The resultant code stack could then be restructured to be entirely in Perl or
in Java or both, possibly with a GUI in Java.
